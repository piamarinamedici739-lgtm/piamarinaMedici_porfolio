#  Pia Marina Medici | Academic & Technical Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. This project serves as a digital hub to showcase my academic milestones, technical capabilities, and my 2025 Capstone Project.

The website is built with a focus on clean, semantic HTML, responsive CSS (utilizing CSS Variables and Grid/Flexbox), and vanilla JavaScript for interactive DOM manipulation.
